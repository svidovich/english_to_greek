## English to Greek Dictionary

These datasets contain the 1,000 most commonly used words in English as reported by [1000mostcommonwords.com](https://1000mostcommonwords.com/1000-most-common-english-words/), directly translated using Google Translate. The `annotated.csv` and `annotated.json` files contain the words alongside their definitions. The data comes in several formats. It was reformatted using scripts from another one of my projects, [language-flashcards](https://github.com/svidovich/language-flashcards). A script is included to convert the annotated CSV file to JSON.
